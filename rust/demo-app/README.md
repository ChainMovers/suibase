# demo-app

A good starting point for Rust+Move development on VSCode.

What to expect?
 - A simple Rust+Move dApps that simply increment a Counter on your localnet.
 - The counter emit a Move event on every increment.
 - Rust app that subscribe and show all Sui Move events (do "cargo run events") 
 - Rust app to send a transaction to increment the counter (do "cargo run count").
 - Use of sui-base scripts and helper to accelerate and automate Sui development.
