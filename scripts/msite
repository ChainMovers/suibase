# This script simply call the proper 'site-builder' binary and config combination to interact
# with remote mainnet Walrus network (operated by Mysten Lab).
#
# Your mainnet workdir should have been created when you
# did 'mainnet start' or 'mainnet update'.
#
# You use 'msite' in the same way you would use 'site-builder' from Mysten. Example:
#    'msite publish'
#
# One convenience is you do not have to specify the --config and --context,
# since this script will provide all the matching config files for mainnet.
