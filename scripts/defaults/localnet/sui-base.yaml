# network_type: local | remote | switchable
#
# Typically, you will not override this variable. It defines if the
# workdir is starting a local Sui process or communicate with a
# remote network.
#
# "switchable" is for the Mysten Lab ~/.cargo/bin/sui binary
# installation procedure and the user can switch the target
# network "at will". In this case, the network type is unknown
# and some features will not work (notably there is no sui-repo).
#
network_type: local

# This control the *default* git repo being used and updated to latest
# when building the client to communicate with the network.
#
# Take note that these variables are ignored when there is
# a 'set-sui-repo' forcing the use of a repo.

default_repo_url: "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git"
default_repo_branch: "devnet"
