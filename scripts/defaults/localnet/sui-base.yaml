# Typically, you will not override this variable. It defines if the
# workdir is starting a local Sui process or communicate with a
# remote network.

# "switchable" is for the Mysten Lab ~/.cargo/bin/sui binary
# installation procedure and the user can switch the target
# network "at will". In this case, the network type is unknown
# and some features will not work (notably there is no sui-repo).
