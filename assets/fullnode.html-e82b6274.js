It is fast, reliable, deterministic with unlimited funds.</p><p>Consider using devnet/testnet only when you have reach the point of depending on other dApps, you are established and need a public presence or as the last steps before going on mainnet.</p><p>Keep in mind that your development may come to a halt when devnet/testnet is being wiped out, and you have to wait on someone else module publication. Consider this versus getting in the habit of publishing all your dependencies on your own localnet...</p><p>If your goal is to learn Move, then definitely start with localnet. For suibase users, it is as simple as doing <code>$ localnet start</code>.
