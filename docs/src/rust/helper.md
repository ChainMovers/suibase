title: Rust Suibase Helper API
---

See the [crates documentation](https://chainmovers.github.io/suibase-api-docs)

To use the helper add the following to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
suibase = { path = "../../suibase/rust/helper" }
```

It is assumed suibase is already installed, and you may have to adjust the number "../" depending on where your Cargo.toml is located relative to ~/suibase.
