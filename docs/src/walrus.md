Walrus is fully integrated with Suibase, so it "just works" out of the box.

Suibase makes it easy to develop concurrently with Walrus testnet and mainnet with the peace of mind that every operation is done with the proper binary and config matching the network.

## Walrus

Use `twalrus` for testnet and `mwalrus` for mainnet instead of calling `walrus` directly.

In same way, use `tsite` and `msite` instead of `site-builder`.

Suibase scripts appends the proper --config, --context and wallet path to make sure you are using the correct mix of binaries and configs.

The scripts pass all your command line parameters as-is to the original Mysten Labs binaries.

## Updates
Run `testnet update` or `mainnet update`.

This updates all binaries/configs to match the latest deployed testnet/mainnet.

In rare case of testnet reset from Mysten Labs, you may need to do `~/suibase/update`... which is recommended to be done periodically anyway to keep Suibase itself up-to-date.

## Wallets

Some walrus commands require a wallet. By default, the active-address of the Suibase wallet is used.

This wallet has 15 addresses automatically generated when you did install Suibase.

Use `tsui` and `msui`, instead of `sui`, to access the proper wallets. Some useful commands are:

```bash
$ tsui client active-address
$ tsui client gas
$ tsui client switch --address <address or alias>
# Note: For mainnet, use `msui` instead.
```

## File Locations
Backup your wallets.

All wallets (sui.keystore) and yaml configs are stored in two locations.

testnet: `~/suibase/workdirs/testnet/config-default/`
mainnet: `~/suibase/workdirs/mainnet/config-default/`

A convenient `recovery.txt` file has the mnemonics of the 15 addresses generated by Suibase.

The binaries downloaded from Mysten Labs are located in:
testnet: `~/suibase/workdirs/testnet/bin/`
mainnet: `~/suibase/workdirs/mainnet/bin/`

Keep in mind that if you call the binaries directly (instead of using the scripts), you will have to specify your own config, context and wallets.
