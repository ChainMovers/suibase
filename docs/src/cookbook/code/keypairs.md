## Facts

::: tip Fact Sheet

- Sui keys, on disk for Sui binaries, are in file: `$HOME/sui_config/sui.keystore `
- Keys are persisted in the file as a JSON array
- Entries in the array are base64 encoded strings e.g.: `AIUPxQveY18QxhDDdTO0D0OD6PNV+et50068d1g/rIyl`
- When base64 decoded, the byte counts of key strings is 33
- The first byte of the decoded key indicates the key type followed by the 32 byte private key seed
- Key types:
  - 0 -> ed25519 keytype
  - 1 -> secp256k1 keytype
  - 2 -> secp256r1 keytype
- Public keys are generated from the private keys. The length of the public key in bytes:
  - 0 -> 32 bytes
  - 1 -> 33 bytes
  - 2 -> 33 bytes
- Sui addresses are hex strings 66 characters long with prefix '0x', e.g.: `0xa9e2db385f055cc0215a3cde268b76270535b9443807514f183be86926c219f4`
- Sui addresses are generated by hashing the key type and the public key bytes, converting to a hex string
  and prefixing with '0x'
- blake2b is used for hashing

## How to generate a new Keypair

Different actions that you make with Sui libraries require a keypair. A keypair can be generated by using cryptographic algorithms such as: Ed25519, ECDSA Secp256k1 & ECDSA Secp256r1.

## How to restore a Keypair from a secret

If you already have your secret, you can get your Keypair and you can use it to perform different actions.
