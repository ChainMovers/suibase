# Fullnode

TODO:

* Briefly explain benefit of running your own devnet node (because the public one is sometimes down or too busy).

* Do not repeat here the installation procedure "pin" in Discord node operators. Pointless (and moderators are rightfully not warm about 3rd party procedures). Just mention, docker or service...  and warn about pitfall of using Contabo and such.

* Tell about SuiMon local installation and remote monitoring such as scale3  + andrew + suiscan.xyz monitoring

* May be at some point a section about Prometheus + Grafana for advanced user.
