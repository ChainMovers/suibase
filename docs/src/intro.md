# What is Suibase?

Suibase makes it easy to create "workdirs", each defining a distinct development environment targeting a network.

Other features like:
  * Fast install latest binaries and matching repos with a simple "update" command.
  * **$ localnet star/stop/status** scripts and faucet.
  * **$ localnet regen** script to reset the network with consistent tests addresses and alias (all pre-funded with an abundance of Sui).
  * **$ lsui/dsui/tsui/msui** scripts calls the **proper** sui client binary+config combination for localnet/devnet/testnet/mainnet respectively. No "switch env" needed anymore.
  

Easy to [install](how-to/install.md).

Suibase does not conflict with your existing sui installation in ~/.cargo/bin.
