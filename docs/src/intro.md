# What is Suibase?

Suibase makes it easy to create "workdirs", each clearly defining a development environment targeting a network.

Other features like:
  * Fast install latest binaries and matching repos with a simple "update" command.
  * **$ localnet star/stop/status**
  * **$ localnet regen** to quickly reset the network with consistent tests addresses (all pre-funded with an abundance of Sui).
  * **$ localnet publish** for quick edit/debug cycle.
  * **$ lsui/dsui/tsui/msui** shortcut to call the **proper** sui client binary+config combination for localnet/devnet/testnet/mainnet respectively.
  * **$ localnet faucet <address\>**... etc ... you get the picture...

Easy to [install](how-to/install.md).

Suibase adds scripts making it easy to maintain independent "workdirs" to develop and test your Sui applications. It does not conflict with your existing sui installation.
