# Sui-Base is Community Driven

## How to be a writer for the Cookbook?

The website is built from markdown files (.md) and served directly from github.

Anyone is welcome to submit changes (with pull request) to the sui-base repo.

**Markdown**

Website is written with markdown files (.md) and generated by mkdocs for material ( See 
    [additional markup features]( https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/ ) )

Edit [mkdocs.yml]( https://github.com/sui-base/sui-base/blob/main/docs/mkdocs.yml ) to add new content to the left side navigation.

**Running/Editing The Website**

You can run the whole website locally with just pip and git (See [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) for more installation methods).

```
1. Clone the sui-base repo (recommended at $HOME a.k.a the ~ level)

2. $ cd ~/sui-base/docs

3. $ python3 -m venv env; source env/bin/activate

4. $ pip install mkdocs-material

5. $ pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin

6. $ mkdocs serve

7. Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

The server watch for file changes and updates your browser automatically.
