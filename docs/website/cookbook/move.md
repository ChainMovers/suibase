# Move Language

This is an easy mini-project for first time contributor.

Suggested guidelines: Refer to existing resources... avoid repeat what is already well done somewhere else. Start with a simple "External Resources" Section to just enumerate blindly everything, and then *slowly* evolve an *original* section specific to the cookbook. It has to add value, otherwise stick to the external resources.
