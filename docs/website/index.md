# What is Sui-Base?

sui-base makes it easy to create "workdirs", each clearly defining a development environment targeting a network.

Other features like:

  * **$ localnet star/stop/status**
  * **$ localnet regen** to quickly reset the network with consistent tests addresses (all pre-funded with an abundance of Sui).
  * **$ localnet publish** for quick edit/debug cycle.
  * **$ lsui/dsui/tsui** shortcut to call the **proper** sui client binary+config combination for localnet/devnet/testnet respectively.
  * **$ localnet faucet <address\>**... etc ... you get the picture...

Easy to [install](how-to/install.md).

Sui-base adds scripts making it easy to create independent "container" to develop and test your Sui applications. It does not conflict with your existing sui installation.

Sui-base is community driven and welcome any Sui dev tool discussion on [Discord :octicons-link-external-16:](https://discord.com/invite/Erb6SwsVbH)

<h2>Stay tune... more coming for dApps debugging and test automation !!!<h2\>
